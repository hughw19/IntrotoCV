title: Deep Learning II
tldr: "[Classification and Semantic Segmentation] Training neural networks: improve fitting and avoid overfitting; Classification: Cross-Entropy/SVM Loss, K-NN, from AlexNet to ResNet; Semantic segmentation: UNet, DeepLab; Pretraining and Finetuning"

Why CNN is better? Training Neural Networks: data preprocessing, weight initialization, optimizer, learning rate
Improve CNN training: underfit (Batchnorm, ResNet)
